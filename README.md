Elegoo Smart Robot Car V4.0

I got this car for Christmas. It's a fun little kit. Pretty easy to assemble.
It can be controlled with a remote and from a phone/tablet app over Wifi.

This repository is based on the source version SmartRobotCarV4.0_20201218.
From the file [ELEGOO Smart Robot Car Kit V4.0 2020.12.30.zip](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1XGUjJpgJMPCLtBngYg1dYron1GePzHEl/view?usp=sharing) downloaded from the
[ELEGOO website](https://www.elegoo.com/pages/arduino-kits-support-files).
I've made a few updates from some of the later releases.

The Python library `SmartCar` is my own creation for controlling the robot.
Currently it only supports TCP/IP commucations with the Smart Car.
There is an example program `SmartCar/example.py` for using the library.
Right now the example program only supports Windows.
See the file `SmartCar/README.md` for more details.
